# DS4002P3
## Software and Platform
* The primary software used for this project was Python, specifically using Interactive Python Notebook files (ipynb). These files were created and used with Google Colab and Rivanna. Data was gathered on Google Colab by using webscraping.
* The following packages were used to gather data:
    * BeautifulSoup - parses HTML content to allow easy access to web page elements
    * display - render HTML or other outputs
    * HTML - allows for embedding HTML content directly
* 
* Three laptops were used, where two devices used Mac, while one was conducted on Windows.

## Reproducing Results Instructions
In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.

In order to complete this study, users should:
1. Find and collect data from GoodRead's
